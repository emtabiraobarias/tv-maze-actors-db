# tv-maze-actors-db
Demonstration of data services engineering through creating REST API services from a database repository

## What is this about?
A Flask-Restx data service that allows a client to read and store information about actors/actresses, and allows the consumers to access the data through a REST API. The source data is retrieved from *TV Maze API* source URL [http://api.tvmaze.com/] with added functionalities that would require saving to an external (local) database.
